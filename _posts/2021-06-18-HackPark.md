pennywise

## 2) What request type is the Windows website login form using?

```

## 3) Guess a username, choose a passwordlist and gain credentials to a user account!

From the hints we can see that username is admin, and we will be using the infamous rockyou.txt as the password list.

Using BurpSuite to intercept we can see the post form and the body of the post form.

## 5) What is the CVE?

Now we have to gain access to the machine using a reverse shell, but we can look for a vulnerability on www.exploit-db.com and searching "BlogEngine"

We found what we're looking for.
